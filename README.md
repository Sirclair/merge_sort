# Merge Sort

## Description

Merge Sort is a classic divide-and-conquer algorithm that efficiently sorts an array by recursively splitting it into smaller subarrays, sorting those subarrays, and then merging them back together. Known for its stable sorting properties and O(n log n) time complexity, Merge Sort is an excellent choice for sorting large datasets.

## Installation

To use the Merge Sort algorithm in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sirclair/merge-sort.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd merge-sort
    ```

## Usage

Here’s how to use the Merge Sort algorithm:

1. **Import the `merge_sort` Function**:

    Import the `merge_sort` function from the module in your Python script:

    ```python
    from merge_sort import merge_sort
    ```

2. **Call the Function**:

    Use the `merge_sort` function by passing the array you want to sort:

    ```python
    # Example usage
    array = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
    sorted_array = merge_sort(array)
    print(sorted_array)
    ```

    This will output:

    ```python
    [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]
    ```
